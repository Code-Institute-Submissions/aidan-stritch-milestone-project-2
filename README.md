# City Trip Planner
City Trip Planner provides a user with a simple search ability that allows them 
to easily select a city and narrow down the results to show only those that the 
customer is interested in seeing.

Once they have selected their options, the user can view these on a map showing
all results within 5 miles of the map center. They can also view a detailed list
of these results for more information on each result. 

Should they wish to have a record of what they searched for, the user can provide 
an email address and their name, and have the options searched for emailed to them.

In essence, this website allows the user to find results they are actually interested
in and plan their next trip away in 5 easy steps. 

## UX
This project was designed to fulfill the following criteria;
1. Select a destination city
2. Find tourist attractions in the selected city
3. Find accommodation results in the selected city
4. Find nearby bars & restaurants in the selected city
5. Showcase the full list of results in a visually appealing manner
6. Ensure that the website is responsive on all devices

To help the user select their destination city, this website uses two methods;
1. The user can select by clicking a button one of the most popular destinations
2. The user can type into an input field and google autocomplete will prompt them with results based on their input

We have opted to use these two methods as the popular destinations buttons allow
the user to quickly and easily select their destination city while the autocomplete
input allows them to find any other city that they may require. This has been 
labelled as Step 1 so that the user can follow their progress to know which area
is next to complete or view. 

Step 2 lets the user select their search type by clicking on a button. The user 
is provided with 4 options; 
1. Attractions
2. Accommodation
3. Bars & Restaurants
4. All results

Once the user has selected their city and their search type, their chosen options 
are shown in the "current Selection" area so that they are constantly aware of 
which results they will be viewing. 

In order to avoid confusion and to minimise the viewing pane for the user, once
they click on "show" in step 3, the step 1 and step 2 areas will be hidden from 
view. At the same time, the Google map will be shown to the user and will showcase
the results from the search the user has requested based on the chosen options. 

The user can click on the map marker icon to view some basic information on the 
individual result and will be prompted to see the step 4 area for more information. 

In step 4, the user can click on "show" again to hide the map and reveal a list
of the results that contains a summary of the information available such as the
name, rating, address and contact information. This will allow the user to take 
note of any results they may wish to visit on their trip. 

Step 5 allows the user to send a summary of what options had been used for the 
search and prompt them to return to search again for results in their next city 
trip. 

The Desktop view has been kept minimalistic in order to avoid unnecessary noise 
for the user so that they can focus on their city trip search. 

When scaled down, the website remains responsive so that the user can have a good 
UX on any screen size. When viewed on the smallest screen sizes, the website is 
still visually appealing and easy to navigate and use.
