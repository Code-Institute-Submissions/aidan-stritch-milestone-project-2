# City Trip Planner
City Trip Planner provides a user with a simple search ability that allows them 
to easily select a city and narrow down the results to show only those that the 
customer is interested in seeing.

Once they have selected their options, the user can view these on a map showing
all results within 5 miles of the map center. They can also view a detailed list
of these results for more information on each result. 

Should they wish to have a record of what they searched for, the user can provide 
an email address and their name, and have the options searched for emailed to them.

In essence, this website allows the user to find results they are actually interested
in and plan their next trip away in 5 easy steps.
